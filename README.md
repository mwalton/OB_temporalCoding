Artificial Olfaciton Experiments
==================

Machine Learning algorithms for use in experiments involving real and simulated olfactory sensor data. Simulated datasets generated by CFD (turbulent environments) and biokinetic model of olfactory receptor neurons. Real data borrowed from various gas sensing experiments involving metal oxide sensors.
  
Implemented using sk-learn python machine learning library.  
Research conducted for Evolved Machines Inc.
