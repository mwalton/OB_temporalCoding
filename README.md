ao-SVM
==================

A support vector classifier for use in experiments involving real and simulated olfactory sensor data  
Simulated datasets generated by CFD (turbulent environments) and biokinetic model of olfactory receptor neurons  
Real data borrowed from various gas sensing experiments involving metal oxide sensors  
  
Implemented using sk-learn python machine learning library  
Includes object oriented structure and tools for data normalization / standardization,  
hyperparameter optimization (via grid search and randomized grid search) and k-folds cross validation  
Research conducted for Evolved Machines Inc.
